        <h3>Five Survive</h3>
        <p>Author: Holly Jackson</p>
        <p>Rating: 5/5 </p>
        <p>Review: 5/5</p>
        <p>This book is truly enjoyable. While the beginning may seem slow, it gradually becomes more captivating as the story unfolds. Although certain parts may feel repetitive and some characters could be irksome, these elements contribute to the book's depth; when readers become emotionally invested in the characters and their decisions. The unexpected ending is particularly well-executed, and the protagonist's journey of self-assertion is admirable. Witnessing the character's assertiveness in the end is deeply satisfying. The meticulous plotting and resolution result in a satisfying conclusion. This book comes highly recommended for its compelling narrative and character development.</p>

        <h3>Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close</h3>
        <p>Author: Jonathan Safran Foer</p>
        <p>Rating: 4/5</p>
        <p>This book offers a profound exploration of themes such as trauma, violence, loss, war, heartbreak, family fractures, bullying, isolation, depression, anxiety, self-harm, suicidal ideation, hopelessness, philosophy, nihilism, existential questioning, and death. Much of the narrative is centered on or narrated by a child, adding to its emotional impact. It is a deeply touching story that prompts readers to contemplate life. However, be aware that the book delves into heavy subject matter, so it's important to approach it with mental readiness.</p>
